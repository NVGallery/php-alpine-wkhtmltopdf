# PHP CLI/FPM on Alpine Linux

## Tags
Versions and tags are based on PHP 5.x and 7.x versions.
* `cli-5.6`
* `cli-7.0`
* `fpm-5.6`
* `fpm-7.0`

The `cli` tag is designed to be used for command line stuff. 
The `fpm` tag is designed to be used with PHP-FPM (and fit very well with an Alpine/Nginx docker image).
